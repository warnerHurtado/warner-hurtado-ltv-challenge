# Challenge Warner Hurtado Laguna Part: 2

- For this phase of the challenge, I've chosen to leverage Next.js due to my familiarity and past experience with the technology. Next.js provides a robust framework for building React applications, offering features like server-side rendering, routing, and API routes out of the box. This familiarity allows me to work more efficiently and effectively, ensuring a smoother development process.
- Additionally, TypeScript is being utilized throughout the project to provide static typing for both data and functions. TypeScript enhances code reliability and maintainability by catching potential errors during development, thus reducing debugging time and ensuring a more stable codebase. By leveraging TypeScript, I can ensure that the code is more robust and less prone to runtime errors.
- Furthermore, Tailwind CSS is employed for styling and formatting the website. Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach to styling, providing a comprehensive set of pre-defined utility classes that can be easily applied within the HTML code. This approach streamlines the styling process, allowing for rapid development without the need for writing custom CSS styles from scratch. With Tailwind CSS, I can achieve a consistent and visually appealing design across the entire website.
- In terms of functionality, the website consists of two main views. The "New URL" view enables users to input a new URL, and upon validation, generates a corresponding short URL. This process is seamless and intuitive, providing users with immediate feedback on the validity of their input.
- On the other hand, the "Top 100" view displays a list of the top 100 most frequently accessed URLs. Each entry in the list includes details such as the title, full URL, short URL, and total number of clicks.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
